Passed out in a haze dreaming about something something "me maybe" challenges...
I think I hit my head on the windows?

Arbitrary winapi function calls! Pick your favorite library and function, you get
one argument, and then call it! As many times as you want, though my solution only
needed a single call (`gets` is overpowered).

Since it's running under Wine, basically all of the addresses are static. I don't
think Wine actually does ASLR?? Someone correct me if I'm wrong but after a couple
Wine challenges I haven't seen it do that yet.

Every teams' solution:
1. malloc a buffer
2. gets into that buffer
3. WinExec the buffer

My Clown Solution:
0. Be too lazy to read up the winapi docs
1. You know the stack pointer already, since it's not ASLR or anything
2. Just call gets
3. The argument to gets is the stack pointer
4. It's Just Gets (TM)
5. Blast that ROP chain right over the stack pointer
6. #JustGetsThings
7. When it exits, you just win. For free. Thanks, gets.
8. ðŸ¤¡

ROP chain construction was pretty easy, only weird thing I found is that this msvcrt
module has really shit gadgets for control over rdx. I ended up using some nightmare
combo `pop rdx ; ror byte [rax-0x7d], 0xc4 ; retn` gadget and just setting rax to
some address that can be dereferenced safely. Rest of the chain was standard stuff
since you know the addresses of everything.
